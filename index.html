        <h1>The Best Movies According to Kris</h1>
        <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

        <ol>
        <li><h3>Midnight in Paris</h3></li>
        <img src="./assets/Movie Posters/paris-poster1.jpg" height="400"  alt="Midnight in Paris's Movie Poster"/>
        <p>This is my favourite movie. You can immerse yourself with Gil Pender into the unbelievable time-travelling wonderland. It is the most poetic movie I've ever seen, beautiful and impressive. I feel like sometimes I am actually the actor itself, always like 'Nostalgia' in my own world

        <li><h3>The Invisible Guest</h3></li>
        <img src="./assets/Movie Posters/Invisible Guest.jpg" height="500"alt="The Poster of Invisible Guest"/>
        <p>If you're like me, often can't decide which movie to go to for your precious weekends, please don't hesitate and go ahead click this movie. You'll soon be attracted to it, kind of thriller but most importantly you'll be totally shocked by the truth</p>
